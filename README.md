# Convert Residential Houses into Sustainable Homes Using AI

## üß† Motivation and Overview

Our project aims to transform how individuals assess and improve the sustainability of their homes using AI. Initially considering a chatbot approach, we pivoted to a modern web-based application due to data constraints and academic requirements. The result is a functional, user-friendly platform that offers customized, impactful recommendations to help users enhance the environmental efficiency of their residences.

## ‚ùì Initial Research Question

**"How can we guide users to make their homes more sustainable?"**

Originally, a chatbot was proposed using R. However, due to the lack of structured data and limitations of the R ecosystem for NLP-based applications, we switched to building a more structured AI-driven recommendation application.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Collection

### Data Sources
- Glossary website recommended by the project admin.
- Manual extraction of 100 features related to sustainable housing.

### Data Enhancement
- Categorized features into main and sub-categories.
- Added metadata such as Priority, Implementation, Cost Factor, and Usage.
- Created synthetic data using statistical sampling techniques.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis

### Step 1: Manual Data Gathering
Manual review and entry of 100 key features from the glossary site into an Excel spreadsheet.

### Step 2: Feature Structuring
Each feature classified under:
- **Priority**
- **Implementation**
- **Cost Factor**
- **Usage**

Research from trusted sources (websites, videos, articles) was conducted to justify each classification.

### Step 3: Feature Weight Calculation

Weights were assigned as follows:
- **Priority:** Very High (0.3333), High (0.2222), Medium (0.1111), Low (0)
- **Implementation:** Easy (0.3333), Moderate (0.2222), Hard (0.1111), Very Hard (0)
- **Cost Factor:** Low (0.3333), Moderate (0.2222), Expensive (0.1111), Very Expensive (0)

R code was written to compute the final weight per feature.

### Step 4: Generating a Synthetic Dataset

- **Dataset Size:** 10,000 houses
- Each house: Binary presence (`yes`/`no`) of each of the 100 features
- Stored in: `Sustainability_Houses_Dataset.xlsx`

### Step 5: Calculating Sustainability Scores

Using the calculated weights, each house is scored:
- **Total Sustainability Score**
- **Individual Sub-category Scores**

These scores drive the AI-based recommendation engine.
